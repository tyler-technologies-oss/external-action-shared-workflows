# External Action Shared Workflows

Reusable GitHub Actions workflows for managing forked third-party GitHub Actions with automated upstream sync, tag monitoring, and security scanning.

## Overview

When you fork a third-party GitHub Action to pin it for supply chain security, you need to keep it in sync with upstream while reviewing changes before they reach your workflows. These reusable workflows automate that process.

Each fork contains thin caller workflows (~20 lines) that reference these reusable workflows via `workflow_call`. Centralized maintenance means bug fixes and detection improvements propagate to all forks automatically via the floating `@v1` tag.

Forks are bootstrapped by [`fork-action.sh`](https://github.com/tyler-technologies-oss/external-action-setup/blob/main/fork-action.sh), which creates the caller workflows, branch structure, and manifest.

## Workflows

### sync-upstream.yml

Syncs the fork's `upstream-tracking` branch with the upstream repository's default branch.

**Inputs:**

| Input | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `upstream_owner` | string | yes | Owner of the upstream repository |
| `upstream_repo` | string | yes | Name of the upstream repository |
| `default_branch` | string | yes | Default branch of the upstream repository |
| `force` | boolean | no | Force sync even if already up to date (default: false) |

**What it does:**
- Checks out the fork's `upstream-tracking` branch
- Verifies upstream repo identity against `repo_id` stored in `FORK_MANIFEST.json` (detects name squatting / repo transfer attacks)
- Fetches the upstream default branch and attempts a fast-forward merge
- Validates and updates `last_synced_sha` in the manifest (enforces 40-char hex format)
- Opens an issue if divergence is detected (non-fast-forward)
- Creates a PR from `upstream-tracking` to the fork's default branch with diff stats, security-relevant file list, and review checklist
- Adds `security-alert` label when security-relevant files are changed (action.yml, Dockerfile, package.json, shell scripts, dist/)

**Outputs:**

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `pr_created` | Whether a sync PR was created or already exists |
| `pr_number` | PR number |
| `in_sync` | Whether the fork is already up to date |
| `merge_success` | Whether fast-forward merge succeeded |
| `has_security_changes` | Whether security-relevant files were changed |

### sync-tags.yml

Monitors upstream tags for new releases, mutations (supply chain risk), and deletions.

**Inputs:**

| Input | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `upstream_owner` | string | yes | Owner of the upstream repository |
| `upstream_repo` | string | yes | Name of the upstream repository |

**What it does:**
- Compares upstream and fork tags using dereferenced commit SHAs (handles annotated vs lightweight tag differences)
- Sanitizes tag names via allowlist (`a-zA-Z0-9._+-`) to prevent injection
- Creates issues for new upstream releases with security review checklists
- Creates security alerts for tag mutations (upstream tag now points to different commit)
- Detects drift between fork tags and `pinned_tags` in `FORK_MANIFEST.json`
- Creates notices for tag deletions (upstream removed a tag)

### security-scan.yml

Runs security analysis on sync PRs, triggered via `workflow_run` after Sync Upstream completes.

**Inputs:**

| Input | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `default_branch` | string | yes | Default branch of the fork |

**What it does:**
- Dependency review (fails on high severity)
- CodeQL analysis (JavaScript/TypeScript repos only; informational, excluded from aggregate status)
- Composite action analysis -- detects changes to `action.yml` refs, `using` field modifications, unpinned action references, and modified `run` steps; creates security alert issues for significant findings
- Diff summary with risk assessment posted as PR comment

## Usage

### Caller workflow examples

**sync-upstream.yml** (in your fork):
```yaml
name: Sync Upstream
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 6 * * 1'
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      force:
        description: 'Force sync even if already up to date'
        required: false
        type: boolean
        default: false

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
  issues: write

concurrency:
  group: sync-upstream
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  sync:
    uses: tyler-technologies-oss/external-action-shared-workflows/.github/workflows/sync-upstream.yml@v1
    with:
      upstream_owner: original-owner
      upstream_repo: original-repo
      default_branch: main
      force: ${{ inputs.force == true }}
```

**sync-tags.yml** (in your fork):
```yaml
name: Sync Tags
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 6 * * 3'
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  issues: write

concurrency:
  group: sync-tags
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  check-tags:
    uses: tyler-technologies-oss/external-action-shared-workflows/.github/workflows/sync-tags.yml@v1
    with:
      upstream_owner: original-owner
      upstream_repo: original-repo
```

**security-scan.yml** (in your fork):
```yaml
name: Security Scan
on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["Sync Upstream"]
    types: [completed]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
  statuses: write
  checks: write
  issues: write
  security-events: write

concurrency:
  group: security-scan
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  scan:
    if: github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'success'
    uses: tyler-technologies-oss/external-action-shared-workflows/.github/workflows/security-scan.yml@v1
    with:
      default_branch: main
```

## Versioning

This repo uses semantic versioning with a floating major version tag:

| Change Type | Example | Version Bump | Fork Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bug fix | Fix SHA comparison | `v1.x.y` patch | None -- auto-propagates via `@v1` |
| New optional input | Add `dry_run` | `v1.x.0` minor | None -- auto-propagates |
| Remove/rename input | Rename `force` | `v2.0.0` major | Update callers, re-run fork-action.sh |

### Releasing a non-breaking update

```bash
git tag -a v1.1.0 -m "Improved tag mutation detection"
git tag -f v1 -m "Latest v1.x release"
git push origin v1.1.0 && git push origin v1 --force
```

## Known Limitations

### CodeQL is limited to JavaScript/TypeScript forks

CodeQL analysis in the security scan only runs on forked actions that contain JavaScript or TypeScript code. Actions written in other languages (Go, Bash, Docker) still receive dependency review, composite action analysis, and diff summary checks, but no static analysis. CodeQL results are informational only and excluded from the aggregate security-scan status.

### Concurrency blocks must be in callers only

GitHub Actions rejects workflows when both the caller and the reusable workflow define `concurrency` blocks. All `concurrency` configuration belongs in the caller workflows, not in the reusable templates.

### Reusable workflow job names are prefixed

When called from a caller, job names are prefixed with the caller's job name. For example, if the caller job is named `scan` and the reusable workflow has a job `dependency-review`, the check name becomes `scan / dependency-review`. Branch protection rules must use the prefixed names.

## Requirements

- This repo must be **public** for cross-repo `workflow_call` to work
- Caller workflows must specify appropriate `permissions` at the workflow top level (not inside jobs) -- `GITHUB_TOKEN` is automatically available to reusable workflows via the caller's permissions block
